1,PM2.5,"PM2.5 is fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Due to their small size, PM2.5 are easily inhalable and have been found to cause various cardiovascular disorders as well as other adverse health outcomes. The sources of PM2.5 are complex but include to varying degrees automobiles, factories, and dust. The EPA standard for annual PM2.5 concentrations is 12 micrograms per cubic meter while the daily standard is 35 micrograms per cubic meter.","PM2.5 measures in the air here are aggregated from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) data, which contains representative ambient air pollution data across different states collected by federal, state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies. Measures from 22 sensors in the area returned daily PM 2.5 data. Each sensor's measures were averaged from past seven days for each day."
2,AQI,"The Air Quality Index (AQI) is used for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. When the AQI is in 0 to 50 range, air quality conditions are good; when in 51 to 100, moderate; 101 to 150, unhealthy for sensitive groups; 151 to 200, unhealthy; 201 to 300, very unhealthy; 301 to 500, hazardous","AQI measures in the air here are aggregated from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) data, which contains representative ambient air pollution data across different states collected by federal, state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies. Measures from 22 sensors in the area returned daily AQI data. Each sensor's measures were averaged from past seven days for each day."
3,COVID,COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.,"COVID measures here are aggregated from the Chicago Data Portal, which contains daily new cases by Chicago Health Department. Each measure were averaged from past seven days for each day."
